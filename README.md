# Portfolio Website v2
Build on NextUI

## Installing the Modules
First, you have to install a packages that the app depends on.
```shell
$ npm install
```

## Building the App
You may run `npm run build` command to build the app.
```shell
$ npm run build
```
By default, the build output will be placed at `dist`. You may deploy this `dist` folder to any of your preferred platforms.

## Testing the App Locally
Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running `npm run preview` command.
```shell
$ npm run build
$ npm run preview
```

The `vite preview` command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at http://localhost:4173. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.

You may configure the port of the server by passing the `--port` flag as an argument.
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preview": "vite preview --port 8080"
  }
}
```
Now the preview command will launch the server at http://localhost:8080.
